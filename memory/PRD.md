# NivXRay · ADR-005 Progress (Handoff-friendly summary)

**Purpose**: Original problem statement, architecture direction, phase status, and next-action pointers.
Long-form artefacts live under `/app/memory/adr/`.

## Original problem statement (owner directive)

Transition NivXRay to an Intelligent Evidence-Driven Decoding Engine (IEDDE) and build the L4 Analyst Workspace. Under a strict architectural freeze (ADR-004), the user discovered Workspace Save Case bypassed the canonical investigation lifecycle — the deeper diagnosis revealed 5 parallel IUE modules and 5 SSOT-shaped objects with no single canonical lifecycle. Rather than another tactical patch, the owner authorised architectural reconciliation (ADR-005).

## Architecture direction (approved 2026-08-10)

```
ANY INPUT
   → Input Health → Canonical IUE (Composer) → IUEDecision (plan[]+dispatch[])
   → Canonical Executor → AuthoritativeSSOT (append-only, provenance-mandatory, fingerprint-addressable, recursive via ssot_ref)
   → Projections (pure functions of authoritative tier)
     ├── Verdict / MITRE / Attack Chain / Attack Story
     ├── IOCs / LOLBAS / Timeline / Executive Summary / Analyst Summary
     ├── Recommendations (NO generic fallback)
     └── Reports (STIX / Sigma / YARA / Navigator / MDR)
   → Workspace (consumers)
```

## Owner decisions (recorded in `adr/0005-owner-decision-matrix.md`)

- D1-D · IUE Composer over existing IUE-2/3/4/5 sub-classifiers
- D2-d · Two-tier canonical SSOT (authoritative graph + projection tier)
- D3-z · ReasoningStep + Provenance envelope (both)
- D4-3 · plan[] + dispatch[] + dispatch_policy
- D6-r · Recursive by ssot_ref (immutable store)
- D7 W1-A · Wave 1 segment-and-continue with locked pre-segment
- D10 · ADR-005 is a prerequisite to ADR-004 Step 2

**Explicit rejections**: no tactical L1b routing fix; no code change against Sample1; no Wave 1 modification beyond future labelling; no ADR-004 Step 2 until D2 lands + labelled Wave 1 authorised.

## Phase status

| Phase | Status | Report |
|---|---|---|
| 1 · Canonical IUE Composer | ✅ CLOSED | `adr/0005-phase1-report.md` + `-signoff.md` |
| 2 · Canonical SSOT authoritative tier | ✅ CLOSED | `adr/0005-phase2-report.md` + `-signoff.md` |
| 3 · Canonical Executor | ✅ CLOSED (A3.1 verified against real Sample.docx) | `adr/0005-phase3-report.md` + `-signoff.md` + `-a3.1-verification.md` |
| 4 · Projection tier | 🟡 SPEC written, awaiting owner review | `adr/0005-phase4-spec.md` |
| 5 · Entry-point convergence | ⛔ NOT authorised |  |
| 6 · Wave 1 relabelling | ⛔ NOT authorised |  |
| 7 · Sample1 acceptance regression | ⛔ NOT authorised |  |
| 8 · Workspace UI + template removal | ⛔ NOT authorised |  |
| 9 · ADR-004 Step 2 verdict switch | ⛔ NOT authorised |  |
| 10 · DEPRECATE (consumer-count = 0) | ⛔ NOT authorised |  |

## Tests

- 116/116 combined P1 + P2 + P3 tests green.
- Sample1 fingerprint `5b4337d5a9fc05923bd3090f1270268ae8eef7af2ccf06f4e8d8492bf908261d` unchanged.
- Verified Sample.docx fixture: `/app/memory/fixtures/Sample.docx` (40 786 bytes, SHA256 `3915b712…8623a7`).

## Golden case

`GOLDEN_CASE_SAMPLE1.md` + `.snapshot.json` — frozen. Rules R-G1..R-G6 apply to case ID `3db79c4a-088b-4df7-b65a-f68b367b7677`.

## Freeze status

| Component | State |
|---|:-:|
| `routers/cases.py` | UNTOUCHED |
| Workspace UI | UNTOUCHED |
| MDR pipeline | UNTOUCHED |
| Engine A | UNTOUCHED |
| Canonical Verdict scoring | UNTOUCHED |
| Wave 1 (2 records) | UNTOUCHED |
| Sample1 case | UNTOUCHED |
| Legacy SSOTs (5) | UNTOUCHED (all imported as donors only, never modified) |

## Capability gaps (informational)

Recorded in `adr/0005-capability-gaps.md` — TEXT_EXTRACT_FROM_ARCHIVE + 8 other analyser stubs. **NOT authorised for implementation.**

## Next action

Owner review of `adr/0005-phase4-spec.md` (two catalog questions embedded in §8).
Only on approval does Phase 4 code work begin, gated by the same Design→Implement→Tests→Sample.docx-NEW-case→Determinism→Sample1-fingerprint→STOP pattern used for Phases 1–3.
