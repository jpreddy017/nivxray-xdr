# NivXRay · ADR-005 Progress (Handoff-friendly summary)

**Purpose**: Original problem statement, architecture direction, phase status, and next-action pointers.
Long-form artefacts live under `/app/memory/adr/`.

## Original problem statement (owner directive)

Transition NivXRay to an Intelligent Evidence-Driven Decoding Engine (IEDDE) and build the L4 Analyst Workspace. Under a strict architectural freeze (ADR-004), the user discovered Workspace Save Case bypassed the canonical investigation lifecycle — the deeper diagnosis revealed 5 parallel IUE modules and 5 SSOT-shaped objects with no single canonical lifecycle. Rather than another tactical patch, the owner authorised architectural reconciliation (ADR-005).

## Architecture direction (approved 2026-08-10)

```
ANY INPUT
   → Input Health → Canonical IUE (Composer) → IUEDecision (plan[]+dispatch[])
   → Canonical Executor → AuthoritativeSSOT (append-only, provenance-mandatory, fingerprint-addressable, recursive via ssot_ref)
   → Projections (pure functions of authoritative tier)
     ├── Verdict / MITRE / Attack Chain / Attack Story
     ├── IOCs / LOLBAS / Timeline / Executive Summary / Analyst Summary
     ├── Recommendations (NO generic fallback)
     └── Reports (STIX / Sigma / YARA / Navigator / MDR)
   → Workspace (consumers)
```

## Owner decisions (recorded in `adr/0005-owner-decision-matrix.md`)

- D1-D · IUE Composer over existing IUE-2/3/4/5 sub-classifiers
- D2-d · Two-tier canonical SSOT (authoritative graph + projection tier)
- D3-z · ReasoningStep + Provenance envelope (both)
- D4-3 · plan[] + dispatch[] + dispatch_policy
- D6-r · Recursive by ssot_ref (immutable store)
- D7 W1-A · Wave 1 segment-and-continue with locked pre-segment
- D10 · ADR-005 is a prerequisite to ADR-004 Step 2

**Explicit rejections**: no tactical L1b routing fix; no code change against Sample1; no Wave 1 modification beyond future labelling; no ADR-004 Step 2 until D2 lands + labelled Wave 1 authorised.

## Tests

- 116/116 combined P1 + P2 + P3 tests green (locked at Phase 3 exit).
- **71/71 Phase 4 tests green** (2026-08-10).
- **9/9 Phase 3.x TEXT_EXTRACT_FROM_ARCHIVE tests green** (2026-08-10).
- Combined P1+P2+P3+P3.x+P4 on Sample1-hosting pod: **196 tests green** (this fresh CI pod: 192 pass + 4 Sample1-required tests skip — same skip-set as at Phase 3 exit).
- Sample1 fingerprint `5b4337d5a9fc05923bd3090f1270268ae8eef7af2ccf06f4e8d8492bf908261d` unchanged; A4.2 golden refresh **DEFERRED** to Sample1-hosting pod before Phase 5 authorization.
- Verified Sample.docx fixture: `/app/memory/fixtures/Sample.docx` (40 786 bytes, SHA256 `3915b712…8623a7`).
- Phase 3.x acceptance: word/document.xml materialises as child SSOT `cssot:sha256:5970886e…2526ae` with 75 evidence nodes (52 URLs, 13 IPs, 6 SHA256, 2 MD5, 1 command) — 5/5 determinism.
- Backend smoke: `/api/`, `/api/health`, `/api/auth/login` = 200; `/api/cases` = 403 (auth-required, expected).

## Golden case

`GOLDEN_CASE_SAMPLE1.md` + `.snapshot.json` — frozen. Rules R-G1..R-G6 apply to case ID `3db79c4a-088b-4df7-b65a-f68b367b7677`.

## Freeze status

| Component | State |
|---|:-:|
| `routers/cases.py` | UNTOUCHED |
| Workspace UI | UNTOUCHED |
| MDR pipeline | UNTOUCHED |
| Engine A | UNTOUCHED |
| Canonical Verdict scoring | UNTOUCHED |
| Wave 1 (2 records) | UNTOUCHED |
| Sample1 case | UNTOUCHED |
| Legacy SSOTs (5) | UNTOUCHED (all imported as donors only, never modified) |

## Capability gaps (informational)

Recorded in `adr/0005-capability-gaps.md` — TEXT_EXTRACT_FROM_ARCHIVE + 8 other analyser stubs. **NOT authorised for implementation.**

## Next action

**Pre-Phase-5 functional acceptance HALTED** — see `adr/0005-pre-phase5-acceptance-report.md`.

Root-cause finding on real Sample.docx (SHA256 `3915b712…8623a7`):
- ✅ Recursive lifecycle works: word/document.xml materialises as child SSOT `cssot:sha256:5970886e…2526ae` with 73 IOC nodes.
- ❌ **MITRE evidence = 0 on the child SSOT**. The canonical MITRE_MAP needle-set matches shell/command signatures (`powershell`, `cmd /c`, `regsvr32`, `rundll32`, `certutil -urlcache`, `curl `, `wget `); Sample.docx carries a **vendor-narrative incident report** (Cisco XDR / RAT / azg51-checkin-1) with **zero** matches to those needles.
- Consequence: shipping Phase 5 today would give a canonical pipeline that leaves the exact Workspace defect (empty MITRE / Attack Chain / Attack Story / evidence-derived Recommendations) unresolved.

**Options for owner (none started, all require explicit authorisation):**
- **Phase 3.y** · Extend MITRE_MAP with narrative-report vocabulary (additive analyzer rules only).
- **Phase 3.z** · Author the `VENDOR_NORMALISER` plug-in (existing plan_builder slot; larger scope).
- Ship Phase 5 with documented capability gap (not recommended).

Sample1 golden refresh: still deferred to Sample1-hosting pod.

## Phase 3.x shipped (2026-08-10) — TEXT_EXTRACT_FROM_ARCHIVE only

- Owner decisions applied verbatim: Q1=1a (child-SSOT recursion) · Q2=2a (existing budget) · Q3=3c (generic UTF-8 filter) · Q4=4a (raw XML — no tag-strip).
- Executor plumbing completed: `store` is now supplied via `ctx["store"]` (single-line change that completes the existing D6-r contract already required by `_cap_recursive_discovery`).
- `_cap_recursive_discovery` now skips archive members already materialised by TEXT_EXTRACT (via `parent_evidence_id` inspection).
- Real Sample.docx pipeline: parent SSOT `58627409…20633d` + 19 archive-member artifacts + 16 populated child SSOTs; `word/document.xml` child yields 73 IOC nodes (52 URLs, 13 IPs, 6 SHA256, 2 MD5).
- P4-FW3 no-fallback re-verified on both parent and child projections.

## Phase 4 shipped (2026-08-10)

- 15 canonical projections in `backend/canonical/projections/` — pure functions of `AuthoritativeSSOT`, no I/O/clock/random, no legacy composer imports.
- P4-FW3 enforced: `project_recommendations` returns `[]` + mandatory reasoning note when SSOT has no MITRE evidence. Banned tokens (`IMMEDIATE`/`THREAT HUNTING`/`CONTAINMENT`/`Isolate the host`) verified absent across every fixture.
- Strict `token-set + length-band` comparator for `canonical_normalised` prose (per owner decision 3-a).
- Sign-off artefacts: `-projection-acceptance.md` (P4.G1), `-allowed-diffs.md` (P4.G2), `-report.md`.
